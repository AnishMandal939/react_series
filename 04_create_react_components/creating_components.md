# Lets see what is component,  how to create component and render component


Inside app.js File creating fresh first component from scratch

* some part is written in public/index.html file and small notes inside node_modules

# Compoenent : 
        * React components let you break up interface into separate pieces that can then be reused and handled independently

        * Each component is responsible for some functionalities

# Before creating component we need to import react and compoenent class in App.js

1) Sweet: Lets dive into App.js now

# Note : can we use style react element by using class="" like we did in normal html ? ans : yes but with warning in react you have to replace class with className and style using double curly braces {{}} i.e style={{color: red;}} for inline and for external add className="your_classname" and you can use now external css but in browser if you inspect you will see class instead of className because html donot have any attribute like className so it gets converted to plain html in browser , this basic example shows that it is a jsx elememt/ syntax


# we'll see about jsx in upcomming sessions
