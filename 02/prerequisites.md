<h1 style="color: green;"> React Local Setup </h1>

<code> Create-React-App</code>

<details>
Previously in 01 series we used cdns links and used React , that is good for practice and small projects but to work for larger products / production level we need to have setup for local setup any time we practice for larger project, because it will be difficult to navigate and work if we start adding more files
    <summary>Do you remember<summary>

</details>

<h1  style="color: green;"> To create Local Setup </h1>

<p style="color: gray;">
    we should have <code>Nodejs and npm </code> installed , npm comes with nodejs installation so you dont need to install it manually
</p>

<h3> Congratulation you have successfully setup nodejs</h3>
<p>If you haven't installed yet</p>
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">  Click Here 
<p>to get downloaded, preferrable is LTS version but you can download any you like</p>


# Now create react app using CLI using 
<code>npx create-react-app your_app_name</code>

# If you want to crete in the same folder that you are currntly in then type  
<code>npx create-react-app ./</code>
<p>Or</p>
<code>npx create-react-app .</code>


# above command will install

- React, react-dom, react-scripts, with barebode react template to start with , webpack and everything, it creates local server too to run 

# now go to project folder and write npm start to run the project

<code>cd folder_name </code> <span> to go inside folder</span>
<code> npm start</code> to run


# Note : when you type npm install it starts a local server to run the program and there you get to links there to start with browser to navigate link what does that mean

<code>It means the link with localhost or 127.0.0.1:3000 is for local server cannot be accessed with any other devices that is connected to your network but</code>
<code> if you choose 192.168.0.103:3000</code><span> you can access this program on any device that is connected to your wifi network any one can access


<h2 style=" color: lightblue;"> Congratulation your first local react app is up and running</h2>


# this is how we setup the local setup
