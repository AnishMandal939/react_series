# React CDNs without installing using npx or npm

React CDN:
https://unpkg.com/react@^16/umd/react.production.min.js
https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.0/u...
https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6....


To load a specific version of react and react-dom, replace 18 with the version number.

Why the crossorigin Attribute?
If you serve React from a CDN, we recommend to keep the crossorigin attribute set:

<script crossorigin src="..."></script>
We also recommend to verify that the CDN you are using sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * HTTP header:


# how to run this program if we havent installed using npm / yarn -> simply 
` open with live server if you are using vs code and if not then open html file with browser and like you used to do in simple html projects `


# here you have created your first hello world project without using npm / yarn
