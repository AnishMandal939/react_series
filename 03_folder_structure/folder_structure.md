# lets understand about folder structure

 * node_modules -> all the node modules were installed with the create-react-app

  * public -> this folder has the html file which is getting rendered and this is the reason just with the help of single page html file we are able to create multiple pages of application thus called react as SPAs, which is the starting point of the application


* src -> here all the files that you make are stored and and is named as compoenent,
<p>Here you will find index.js  which is the main file which gets connected with index.html with the help of id </p>

# comparison

<p> if you compare our 01_basics file structure and here index.html with index.js on combination you will see pretty much same as we have done before using cdns </p>

<code><p> div id root is the first entry point, from where your js file can connect with your index.html file </p></code>

# here we create app compoenent and render it in index.js file and now everything we render new components will be sourced/ linked with App file and index file only consider rendering app.js file


# why do we follow the process of creating components with capital letter ?

<code> just because if anytime our name doesn't get matched with anyother variables or anything else and not to get condused with filename and variable/ anything inside that js file </code>


# In next session we'll see how to create components in react _session 04 ?
